Counting DNA nucleotides in a string. The dataset was a single string of sequence data.

Building on the previous week, the aim of this task was to count DNA nucleotides in a fasta file containing multiple sequences. 
The challenge was to separate the sequences into separate entities, and pull out the title, length and base counts of each, where sequences may also contain ambiguity codes or lower case letters.

Transcribing DNA to RNA. The dataset was a single string of DNA sequence data, which needed to be transcribed to RNA by replacing all instances of "T" or "t" with U.

Finding the reverse compliment of a string of DNA. The dataset was a single string of DNA sequence data.

Calculating the GC content of some sequences in a fasta file, and returning the name of the sequence with the highest GC content, and its proportion of GC.
