Counting DNA nucleotides in a string. The dataset was a single string of sequence data.

Building on the previous week, the aim of this task was to count DNA nucleotides in a fasta file containing multiple sequences. 
The challenge was to separate the sequences into separate entities, and pull out the title, length and base counts of each, where sequences may also contain ambiguity codes or lower case letters.
