#You have been given a FASTA format file (Task2_sequences.fasta) containing 10 #sequences.




#For each sequence, print to the screen or write to a file the following #information:

    #- the name of the sequence (just the AT identifier at the beginning of #each sequence header);




    #- the length of the sequence;

    #- the number of occurrences of each base.




#The sequences may (will) contain IUPAC ambiguity codes and both upper and #lower case characters.  The output can be in any format you like (doesn't #have to be a table), but you should get the same values as in the file #Task2_results.csv.
